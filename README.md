# KarnaughMapProject

This project's function is to create and output a K-map and read it to output the optimized boolean function after
taking minterms as input from the user.

This project can only create 3 variable K-maps therefore the user input must be between 0-7 to define the minterms.

Error checking is implemented in the project to prevent incorrect inputs.

Also, I have included an error message which informs the user that the output is not completely optimized, this error message should never
be reached but was put to detect bugs, so if every encountered, please notify my

Thank you for your interest,
Abdelrahman Abouzeid
